<p class="one">Heal was born on April 28, 2010 out of the belief that equal opportunity is the cornerstone of civilization.
All human beings must have the same opportunity to succeed in life, irrespective of the circumstances they were born into.However, this is far from true.
We at Heal, aspire to change the inequality.We do that by bringing together 
the people who want to give and the organizations that work to make a difference.
An intervention at the right time, like educating one generation or providing livelihood to increase income can help families break the cycle of generational poverty.
India is population rich.Our people are our resources and if each one of us commits to giving regularly,we will be strong enough to solve our problems.
We could even be audacious enough to say that we as a community may not need any aid if we make  giving a way of life.</p>
<p class="two">small actions * lots of people=Big change </p>
